              <p class="mt-1 font-bold text-white z-0">It all began in 1968 when parent-run organizations, particularly Action for 
              Children's Television (ACT), began protesting what they perceived as excessive violence in Saturday-morning 
              cartoons. Most of these shows were Hanna-Barbera action cartoons such as <span class="s1-space-ghost font-black cursor-pointer">Space Ghost<img alt="Space Ghost" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/space_ghost.jpg"></span>, <span class="s1-the-herculoids font-black cursor-pointer">The Herculoids<img alt="The Herculoids" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48 ml-20" src="@/assets/img/slides/the_herculoids.jpg"></span>, and 
              <span class="s1-batgt font-black cursor-pointer">Birdman and the Galaxy Trio<img alt="Birdman and the Galaxy Trio" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48 ml-64" src="@/assets/img/slides/birdman_and_the_galaxy_trio.jpg"></span>, in the end all of them were canceled by 1969 by pressure from the parent 
              groups. Members of these watchgroups served as advisers to <span class="s1-hannah-barbera font-black cursor-pointer">Hanna-Barbera<img alt="Hanna-Barbera" style="margin-left: 480px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48 float-right" src="@/assets/img/slides/hanna_barbera.jpg"></span> and other animation studios to ensure 
              that new programs would be suitable for children.</p>
              <p class="mt-2 font-bold text-white"><span class="s1-fred-silverman font-black cursor-pointer">Fred Silverman<img alt="Fred Silverman" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/fred_silverman.jpg"></span>, executive for daytime programming at CBS, was then looking for a
              show that would both revitalize his Saturday-morning line and please the watch groups. The result was <span class="s1-the-archie-show font-black cursor-pointer">The Archie Show<img alt="The Archie Show" style="margin-left: 400px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/the_archie_show.jpg"></span>,
              based on Bob Montana's teenage humor comic book <span class="s1-archie font-black cursor-pointer">Archie<img alt="Archie" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/archie.jpg"></span>. Also successful were the musical numbers <span class="s1-the-archies font-black cursor-pointer">The Archies<img alt="The Archies" style="margin-left: 320px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/the_archies.jpg"></span> performed
              during each program (one of which, "Sugar, Sugar", was the most successful Billboard number-one hit of 1969). Eager to
              build upon this success, Silverman contacted producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera about creating another show
              based on a teenage rock group, this time featuring teens who solved mysteries between gigs. Silverman envisioned the 
              show as a cross between the popular <span class="s1-iloveamys font-black cursor-pointer">I Love a Mystery<img alt="I Love a Mystery" style="margin-left: 600px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-48 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/iloveamystery.jpeg"></span> radio serials of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the 
              popular early 1960s television series <span class="s1-tmlofg font-black cursor-pointer">The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis<img alt="The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis" style="margin-left: 750px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-24 w-64 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/dobie_gillis_cast.jpg"></span>.</p>

            <div class="ml-16 mr-16 hidden">
              <p class="mt-1 font-bold text-white">After attempting to develop his own version of the show, called House of Mystery,
              <span class="s2-joseph-barbera font-black cursor-pointer">Joseph Barbera<img alt="Joseph Barbera" style="margin-left: 570px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/joseph_barbera.jpg"></span>, who developed and sold Hanna-Barbera shows while <span class="s2-william-hannah font-black cursor-pointer">William Hanna<img alt="William Hanna" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48 ml-32" src="@/assets/img/slides/william_hanna.jpg"></span> produced them, passed the task along to storywriters 
              <span class="s2-joe-ruby font-black cursor-pointer">Joe Ruby<img alt="Joe Ruby" style="margin-left: 550px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/joe_ruby.jpg"></span> and <span class="s2-ken-spears font-black cursor-pointer">Ken Spears<img alt="Ken Spears" style="margin-left: 750px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/ken_spears.jpg"></span>, as well as artist/character designer <span class="s2-iwao-takamoto font-black cursor-pointer">Iwao Takamoto<img alt="Iwao Takamoto" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-56 h-48 ml-40" src="@/assets/img/slides/iwao_takamoto.jpg"></span>. Their treatment, based in part on The Archie 
              Show, was titled Mysteries Five and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, and Linda's brother W.W., along 
              with their bongo-playing dog, Too Much, who collectively formed the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not 
              performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. 
              Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty one. When the 
              former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a <span class="s2-great-dane font-black cursor-pointer">Great Dane<img alt="Great Dane" style="margin-left: 750px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/great_dane.jpg"></span> but revised the dog character to a large <span class="s2-sheepdog font-black cursor-pointer">sheepdog<img alt="sheepdog" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-56 h-48 ml-40" src="@/assets/img/slides/sheepdog.jpg"></span> 
              (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, <span class="s2-hot-dog font-black cursor-pointer">Hot Dog<img alt="Hot Dog" style="margin-left: 470px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-56 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/hot_dog.jpg"></span>) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character 
              would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after 
              consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead 
              of a sheepdog.</p>
              <p class="mt-2 font-bold text-white">During the design phase, lead character designer Takamoto consulted a studio 
                colleague who was a breeder of Great Danes. After learning the characteristics of a prize-winning Great Dane from 
                her, Takamoto proceeded to break most of the rules and designed Too Much with overly bowed legs, a double chin, 
                and a sloped back, among other abnormalities.</p>

            <div class="ml-16 mr-16">
              <p class="mt-1 font-bold text-white">Ruby and Spears' second pass at the show used Dobie Gillis as the template 
              for the teenagers rather than Archie. The treatment retained the dog Too Much, while reducing the number of 
              teenagers to four, removing the Mike character and retaining Geoff, Kelly, Linda, and W.W. As their personalities
              were modified, so were the characters' names: Geoff became "Ronnie" – later renamed "Fred" (at Silverman's behest),
              Kelly became "Daphne", Linda "Velma", and W.W. "Shaggy". The teens were now based on four teenage characters from
              The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis: <span class="s3-dobie font-black cursor-pointer">Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman)<img alt="Dobie Gillis" style="margin-left: 400px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-56 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/dobie.jpg"></span>, <span class="s3-thalia font-black cursor-pointer">Thalia Menninger(Tuesday Weld)<img alt="Thalia Menninger" style="margin-left: 580px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/thalia_menninger.jpg"></span>, <span class="s3-zelda font-black cursor-pointer">Zelda Gilroy (Sheila James)<img alt="Zelda Gilroy" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48 -ml-5" src="@/assets/img/slides/zelda.jpg"></span> 
              and <span class="s3-maynard font-black cursor-pointer">Maynard G. Krebs (Bob Denver)<img alt="Maynard G. Krebs" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-48 h-48 ml-40" src="@/assets/img/slides/maynard.jpg"></span>, respectively.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-2 font-bold text-white">The revised show was re-pitched to Silverman, who liked the material but, disliking the title Mysteries Five, 
              decided to call the show Who's S-S-Scared? Silverman presented Who's S-S-Scared? to the CBS executives as the
              centerpiece for the upcoming 1969–70 season's Saturday morning cartoon block. CBS president <span class="s3-frank-stanton font-black cursor-pointer">Frank Stanton<img alt="Frank Stanton" style="margin-left: 380px;" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-5 w-64 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/frank_stanton.jpg"></span> felt 
              that the presentation artwork was too scary for young viewers and, thinking the show would be the same, decided 
              to pass on it.</p>
              <p class="mt-2 font-bold text-white">Now without a centerpiece for the upcoming season's programming, Silverman 
              had Ruby, Spears, and the Hanna-Barbera staff revise the treatments and presentation materials to tone down the 
              show and better reflect its comedy elements. The rock band element was dropped, and more attention was focused 
              upon Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by <span class="s3-frank-sinatra font-black cursor-pointer">Frank Sinatra's<img alt="Frank Sinatra" class="z-10 hidden absolute border border-white rounded-lg -mt-32 w-48 h-48" src="@/assets/img/slides/frank_sinatra.jpg"></span> scat 
              "doo-be-doo-be-doo" at the end of his recording of "Strangers in the Night" on a red-eye flight to one of the 
              development meetings, and decided to rename the dog "Scooby-Doo" and retitled the show Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! 
              The revised show was re-presented to CBS executives, who approved it for production.</p>
